<h3 align="center">About Me</h3>

### Programming
I stumbled accross programming thanks to a close friend. I really enjoyed the idea of being able to create something that was fully functional and just how I needed it to work. The more I started to learn it, the more I got hooked and realised just how much I could do with this.\
\
The primary languages that I use (and are my personal favourites) are **C# & Java** but I do have a fair amount of experience with others such as **JavaScript**.

#### Projects:
- I have used **C#** in the [Unity](https://unity.com/) game engine to make apps/games in addition to just using pure C# to create automated tasks.
- I have used **JavaScript** with various API's to create applications. This includes but is not limited to [Discord](https://discord.com/) bots & simple simulations.
- My **Java** experience comes from creating [SpigotMC](https://www.spigotmc.org/) [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) plugins.

### PokÃ©mon
I'm a very avid fan. Growing up I played the games and watched the show religiously and to this day it is still one of my favourite things. My favourite PokÃ©mon is **Hisuian Zoroark** but my favourite region will always be Kalos.
